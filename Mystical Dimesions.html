<h1>My History</h1>
<h2>Early Days As A Mystic</h2> <img src="meditation.jpg" alt="Meditation"> <br>
<p>When I was around 25yrs or 26yrs, I cant remember the exact age, I booked into a hospital to help prevent something serious. In this time I decided to make a change that would bring about happiness in an everlasting way.You see growing up I noticed my father was very spiritually fixated. I noticed he would meditate on a daily basis. I even went through a crash course one day when he was explaining the brief steps he follows when meditating.
</p><br>
<p>At the hospital I decided to implement what I learnt all those years ago and unlike starting off the old ways I had done before I made the decision to stick with meditation to gain liberation from the one thing that was causing so much pain in my life,"My Own Mind".</p>
