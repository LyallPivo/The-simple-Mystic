        <p>I am a simple man on the footpath into the current moment. I use <strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_xsXnRd_uc&t=20s&ab_channel=Sadhguru">meditation</a> </strong> and Asanas as my techniques to do so.

    <li>Simply sit in an asana, one on the floor is best, seated. Tilt the head in a slight upward manned with the vertebrea of the neck closely together.
      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
    <li>Practice the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBds5NZ4PRs&ab_channel=Sadhguru">Surya Namaskar Asana</a></strong> a few times a day.</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      <li>Practice <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ODfwJBDgBs&t=530s&ab_channel=ArshaBodhaCenter-SwamiTadatmananda">Kundalin Yoga</a></strong> with extreme care and consideration for you own well being and that of the people around
        you. Kundalini Yoga is extreamly effective at moving the seeker in a very fast trajectory toward the path they have chose on
        there meditation journey</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      <li>Please remember to not rush your progress and take care based on where you are in the physical dimensions. If you live with other people such as family and you seem to spend a lot of time with other people then please make sure to not speed

        up your meditation process as this will have a terrible effect on your system and the systems around you. </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      <li>If for any reason you decide to speed up your process then make sure you have created a stable platform to work from. The Prana within your system will get to an intense level and the human system needs to be at a certain point in order to
        hold it all.</li>
